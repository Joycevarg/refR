<h1>Refr!</h1>

<p>This is a chrome extension that eliminates the need for scrolling up to refer to a figure or paragraph while reading something. Add this extension to your chrome browser and make reading articles on the web easier. Select the text/image that you want to refer and click on "refR this!". The text/image that you wanted to refer will be added to a pane on the right side of the webpage. This pane can be toggled open and close using the refR button on the browser toolbar. The text/image that was refererd previously will be listed in the refR pane even after re-opening the browser. This is because the data is stored in the local storage of the browser.</p>
